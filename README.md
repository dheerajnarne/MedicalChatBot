# Gemma-2-2b-it-ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagicQA

This repository contains the fine-tuned **Gemma-2-2B-IT** model on the `ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagicQA` dataset. The model is optimized for **medical question answering** using **LoRA fine-tuning**, **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** techniques, and **BitsAndBytes quantization** to ensure efficient training and inference.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Base Model**: `google/gemma-2-2b-it`
- **Fine-Tuned Model**: `Gemma-2-2b-it-ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagicQA`
- **Dataset**: `lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k`
- **Tech Stack**: `Hugging Face Transformers`, `LoRA`, `BitsAndBytes`, `PEFT`, `TRL`, `PyTorch`
- **Training Framework**: `SFTTrainer`

## 🚀 Installation
To set up the project, install the required dependencies and configure your environment accordingly. Ensure you have `transformers`, `peft`, `bitsandbytes`, and other required libraries installed for optimal performance.

## 🔧 Model Training
The fine-tuning process incorporates:
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A memory-efficient technique that fine-tunes only selected layers instead of the full model, significantly reducing GPU usage.
- **BitsAndBytes Quantization**: A method for optimizing model storage and reducing memory consumption by loading models in 4-bit precision.
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: Enables training large-scale models efficiently by tuning fewer parameters while preserving high performance.
- **SFTTrainer**: A streamlined trainer from `TRL` (Transformers Reinforcement Learning) that simplifies the fine-tuning process for causal language models.

## 📤 Upload Model to Hugging Face
Once fine-tuned, the model can be uploaded to the Hugging Face Model Hub for easy sharing and deployment. Ensure authentication with the Hugging Face CLI before pushing the model.

## 🔍 How to Use the Model
The fine-tuned model can be leveraged in various medical AI applications, including:
- **Medical chatbots** that provide instant responses to patient queries.
- **Clinical decision support** by assisting doctors in answering health-related questions.
- **Medical research** by retrieving relevant information from extensive datasets.
